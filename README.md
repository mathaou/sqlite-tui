    <summary>How To Build</summary>

##### Linux

    GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64/386 go build

##### ARM (runs kind of slow depending on the specs of the system)

    GOOS=linux GOARCH=arm GOARM=7 go build

##### Windows

    GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64/386 go build

##### OSX

    GOOS=darwin GOARCH=amd64 go build

#### Terminal settings
Whatever terminal emulator used should support ANSI escape sequences. If there is an option for 256 color mode, enable it. If not available, try running program in ascii mode (-a).

#### Known Issues
 - Using termdbms over a serial connection works very poorly. This is due to ANSI sequences not being supported natively. Maybe putty/mobaxterm have settings to allow this?
 - The headers wig out sometimes in selection mode
 - Line wrapping is not yet implemented, so text in format mode should be less than the maximum number of columns available per line for best use. It's in the works!
 - Weird combinations of newlines + tabs can break stuff. Tabs at beginning of line and mid-line works in a stable manner.

##### Help:
    -p / database/.csv path
    -d / specifies which database driver to use (sqlite/mysql)
    -a / enable ascii mode
    -h / prints this message
    -t / starts app with specific theme (default, nord, solarized)
